Strategic planning is one of CompanyA’s core areas of expertise. As such, our firm has spent the last 35 years leading numerous healthcare sector organizations through the strategic planning process. Three example that are similar in scope to this RFP include our projects with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre’s St. John’s Rehab Program Joseph Brant Hospital and Markham Stouffville Hospital.

CompanyA engaged with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre’s St. John’s Rehab Program to develop a Strategic Plan that would establish a balanced, aligned, and cohesive path forward. The plan clearly defined operational roles within the program, supported plans to better integrate with acute care and community partners, enabled the program’s academic and research foci, and defined activities necessary to create a healthy and improved way of care. Our team conducted stakeholder engagement, data analysis, and strategic planning sessions with program leadership, staff, community, patients, and caregivers to reflect local and provincial realities and referral patterns.

CompanyA led Joseph Brant Hospital through a strategic planning process, including facilitated sessions with the Board of Directors to develop a new vision and mission statement. CompanyA then went on to work with the VPs to create their Strategic Action Plan. Following this we provided a full revision of the hospital’s performance management system to enhance objective setting tied to the hospital strategy.

The CompanyA team supported Markham Stouffville Hospital (MSH) in developing a 3-year Strategic Plan that included measurable goals to guide the direction, priorities, and outcomes of the organization while achieving further growth. The Strategic Plan, a high priority of the hospital, was based on a comprehensive review of changing demographics, community needs, future health care trends, and the directions set by the local and provincial governments. Work included an environmental scan, extensive stakeholder consultation, facilitation of Vision, Mission and Strategic Directions, and writing of a new Strategic Plan for the organization. To complement the final strategic plan while considering the hospital’s brand identity, our team developed a branding plan and a communications plan for MSH in collaboration with a branding partner.

CompanyA Inc.

Comment: For the full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.4 and sub--section 3.7.3 of our Proposal document, starting on pages 36 and 56 respectively. 

CompanyA has proposed a fulsome and diverse stakeholder engagement process within our Project Approach (sub-section 3.4), based on our Stakeholder Engagement Methodology (sub-section 3.7.3). Our methods include virtual individual and small group interviews, virtual focus groups or townhalls and an online survey. Should Osler prefer, we have also proposed to use conversation toolkits to empower members of the community conduct engagement activities so that stakeholders are not offput by having people they do not know/may not be comfortable with in their spaces, while still gaining their critical feedback in the process.

Comment: For the full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.4 - Project Approach and sub-section 3.7.3, starting respectively  on pages 36 and 56 of our Proposal document. 

CompanyA has proposed a comprehensive and inclusive approach (sub-section 3.4) to this Strategic Planning engagement. We have proposed several opportunities to engage with each of these groups. This starts with our Discovery interviews o gather additional project insights and environmental context, identify key sensitivities and risks, and confirm expectations for the engagement. Next, we will develop a plan for and conduct a diverse Stakeholder Engagement process to inform our Current State Assessment, that is expected to include the Osler Strategy Management Office, Board of Directors, President and CEO, and Chief of Staff, Medical Advisory Committee, Executive Team and Director of Communications, Staff and Physicians, Patient Family Advisor(s), Volunteers, Academic Partners (Toronto Metropolitan University, Humber College, Sheridan College, and McMaster University), The Central West OHT, and others as appropriate, such as peer hospitals, Ontario Health regional office representatives, foundation(s). Our Stakeholder Engagement process will be developed using our Stakeholder Enagement Methodology (sub-section 3.7.3), using an appropriate multi-modal approach to both requesting participation and the engagement itself. The insights gathered from that process will be used to create our Current State Summary Report, that will in turn be used to guide the development of the new Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan sessions will also be designed to include all necessary representatives. Once the Strategic Plan has been developed, it will be presented to the Project Sponsor, Strategy Management Office, Board of Directors and key stakeholders to socialize the document.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.7.5 - Communications Planning, starting on page 70. 

Our team will support in the development of a Communication Plan and Strategy that identifies a range of communication mechanisms to effectively communicate with internal and external stakeholders. The Plan and Strategy will be develped through the following steps:
1. Scoping: We collaborate with Osler to define communication roles, considering stakeholder and channel options based on Osler's resources.
2. Planning: We identify stakeholder groups and communication strategies, aligning with Osler's goals, IAP2 approaches, and channel preferences.
3. Communications Plan Development: We draft and finalize a Communications Plan with Osler, ensuring alignment before execution.
4. Implementation: We execute the plan as agreed.
5. Monitoring and Adjustment: We continually monitor and adapt communications to meet Osler's goals and stakeholder needs.

The Communications Plan and Strategy will also result in a Key Messages document to be included in the Final Report.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.7.6 - Approach to Analysis, starting on page 72. 

Once stakeholder engagement activities are completed, our team will analyze all the information collected and group the input into digestible key themes and considerations. In summary our process for extracting themes from engagement outputs is as follows: 

1. Initial Theming: Identifying common themes from the various sources of engagement.
2. Segments: Identifying distinct stakeholder segments with varying opinions.
3. Strength of Sentiment: Considering the intensity of each segment of opinions.
4. Analysis: Analyzing themes to develop strategic considerations.
5. Spot Checks: Revisiting comments as needed for validation and nuance.
6. Presentation: Summarizing findings, themes, and strategic considerations with supporting evidence and data for clarity.

Once the themes and insights have been extracted from the engagement outcomes, our team will incorporate them into the Current State Summary Report.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.6 - Risk and Mitigation Strategies, starting on page 49. 

The CompanyA team and Osler will work collaboratively to monitor progress and take appropriate steps to mitigate potential risks as they emerge. Our team will work with the Osler’s Project Sponsor and key stakeholders to identify risk management strategies employed by the Osler to incorporate into the risk management plan where appropriate. We anticipate that stakeholder availability may be challending, and will mitigate this by planning engagement early, group activities to maintain momentum and request backup contacts if a stakeholder is not available. We also anticipate that participants will have competing prioties and engagement across the organization, so we will will ensure we are contacting the right people in the right ways at the right times to maximize efficiency and allow sufficient scheduling flexibility through virtual engagement and back-up dates. We are also aware that there may be re-occurence of public health measures and Pandemic-type issues, and we have planned for and can switch to significant virtual engagement throughout the project. We have extensive experience with these tools and will ensure no or minimal barriers to access and that potential disruptions will be identified and addressed in advance. Lastly, we recognize the potential for a delay in availabilty of data and documents. To remedy this we will identify data sources and submit data requests as early as possible and identify, in collaboration with Osler Project Sponsor, a key point of contact for data coordination.

CompanyA excels in conducting environmental scans and leading practices research. With extensive experience across industries, we have honed our methods to efficiently gather comprehensive and diverse information. Our systematic and proven analytical methodologies deliver intelligent solutions and successful outcomes. We specialize in tracking hard-to-find data, synthesizing disparate information into trends, and extracting implications. To derive To derive qualitative insights we conduct in-depth desk research, meticulously sifting through the wealth of available data and staying attuned to recent government announcements, such as those related to the Ontario Health Team (OHT) and then we engage in insightful interviews with peer organizations within the healthcare industry, extracting qualitative data from key stakeholders. To derive quantitative insights, we begin by developing a document and data request, clearly outlining which data elements are required, where they should derive from, the purpose for request, and other scoping details such as time and qualifiers. CompanyA will run an analysis of the data and then consolidate the key findings to extract relevant takeaways. Our team will then incorporate the findings and insights into our Current State Summary Report that will serve as a pre-reading document and inform the strategic planning process.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see sub -section 3.4.1 - Working with the Strategy Management Office and sub- section 3.4 - Project Approach and of the Proposal document, starting on pages 47 and 36.

CompanyA regularly engages with strategic planning steering committes and strategy management officces throughout the development of strategic planning, as well as other types of projects such as reviews. We involve the committee or office throughout the project including in planning for engagement and communciation, check-points during the project, and strategy/recommendations development, review, and validation.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.4 - Project Approach and sub-section 3.7.3  Stakeholder Engagement of the proposal document, starting on pages 36 and 56 respectively. 

Our Project Approach (sub-section 3.4) includes stakeholder and engagement planning. Our team will design a Stakeholder Engagement Framework and Consultation Plan for all in-scope project activities in collaboration with the Osler Project Sponsor. The Plan will serve as a foundational document including research questions to be answered as part of this work, and who will be engaged in stakeholder interviews/focus groups, and strategic planning sessions during the project. All interviews and engagement sessions will be facilitated by at least two (2) experienced CompanyA team members using proven techniques that will engage all participants to share their ideas and perspectives. We recognize and acknowledge that engagement planning should be designed with a focus on inclusion and accessibility. CompanyA will also work with Osler to identify a multi-modal approach, including virtual engagement tools and techniques to engagement to ensure accessible and inclusive engagement process and identify accommodations as necessary. We will use active listening techniques in interviews and focus groups to make sure all stakeholders feel heard and valued through the engagements as well as have a dedicated note-taker present so that all input is captured. 

Our stakeholder engagement approach will be built and delivered using our Stakeholder Engagement Methodology (sub-section 3.7.3) includes a suite of techniques that will be selected from in collaboration with the Project Sponsor. Some of these include: online surveys and polling, teleconferencing and townhalls.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see subsection 3.4 - Project Approach and subsubsection 3.7.2 - Facilitation Methodology of the proposal, staring on pages 36 and 54 respectively. 

Our Project Approach (subsection 3.4) details the stages of the project where and when the Board, Executive team and Management will be engaged in the process of developing the new Strategic Plan. In any and all of these meetings our team will use proven faciliation techniques, detailed in our Facilitation Methodology (subsubsection 3.7.2). CompanyA resources have performed facilitation services for organizations in a variety of sectors across North America, working with all levels of staff and leadership in groups of varying sizes and composition. The collective experience gained through the delivery of hundreds of facilitated sessions has given our consulting team a clear understanding of best practices in facilitation. Key features and techniques of the innovative CompanyA approach to facilitation include:
1. Rigorous preparation: Each session is preceded by robust discovery work, where we confirm session priorities and develop best-fit communication methods for the target group, validated with the Project Sponsor where required. 
2. Proven tools and communication frameworks: Our session preparation allows us to identify the unique combination of best-fit tools and activities for each session given the composition of the participant group, the organizational context, and the goals of the engagement. This ensures a high level of participant engagement, and a shared understanding of session goals and outcomes.
3. Dynamic agenda development: Agendas are developed in advance where it is appropriate to do so, but dynamic, in-session agenda development can also be an extremely effective tool to gain trust and outcome ownership from session participants. This is best when session goals are more broadly defined; importantly, our facilitators are proficient at keeping sessions on track, so a dynamic agenda never leads to an unfocused or meandering session. 
4. Dual facilitator model: We arrange each session to be administered by two experienced facilitators, which allows for real-time documentation of session findings and discussion points. Having two facilitators means that discussion momentum is not compromised by transcription issues, allowing us to provide much richer post-session analysis.
5. Post session knowledge transfer: Following any facilitation engagement, we not only provide session outcome analysis and recommended next steps to our client, but we also endeavor to transfer any applicable tools or methodologies utilized in the session to strengthen your internal capabilities and promote continuous development in your organization. This is a value-add service that demonstrates our commitment to creating business partnerships, as opposed to business dependencies.

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see subsection 3.7.6 - Approach to Analysis, starting on page 72 of our proposal document. 

CompanyA is committed to working with Osler to deliver an actionable, achievable and exciting strategic plan that will lead the organization for the years to come. Our Approach to Analysis (sub-section 3.7.6) details how we will use insights from active listening to stakeholders and research outputs to derive  informed recommendations that are supported withevidence. Our approach

1. Creates a validation process to ensure we have properly heard and listened to stakeholders and correctly captured the information through the process of current state report development and validation 
2. Creates recommendations at the intersection of what was learned from stakeholders engaged, the data analyzed, and how best practices can be applied to the specific client organization
3. Ensures the recommendations have strong justification and supporting evidence
4. Holds true to the experiences and input of those stakeholders engaged
5. Prevents any unpleasant “surprises” when it comes time to review final recommendations and provide feedback
6. Ensures actionable recommendations that will fit the organization, rather than applying generic ideas that may not work in the client’s specific context

Comment: For our full response to this question, please see sub-section 3.4 - Project Approach and sub-section 3.7.1 The Accoutability Framework System of the proposal, starting on pages 36 and 50 respectively. 

Our Project Approach for this engagement with Osler includes two strategic planning sessions. Our second session will focus developing an Action Plan that will identify Key Strategic Initiatives and Objectives for each Strategic Direction of the Strategic Plan that will outline the actions needed to progress and succeed using the new strategy. To do so, our team will leverage the second component of our Accountability Framework System (AFS) approach. Our AFS (sub-section 3.7.1) has been adapted by our team hundreds of times for hospitals and health sector organizations and we understand that Measuring performance in Acute Care Hospitals in Ontario has some specific requirements and performance indicators need to be considered. Strategic plan indicators should allow the leadership and board to understand how the strategic plan is advancing and those indicators may include required acute care hospital quality measures. The CompanyA team is well versed in different quality measures, including the experience of Nathan Duyck and Andrea Spencer in working with other acute care hospitals, Janice Dusek from working as a hospital EVP and consulting experience, and Lara de Waal in her data analysis and reporting expertise. More information on this can be found in the section of the AFS (sub-section 3.7.1) titled Performance Measurement in Ontario Acute Care Hospitals.

Comment: For our full response to this question please see subsubsection 3.7.4 - Project Delivery Methodology  of the proposal, starting on page 65. 

CompanyA will manage this project using our innovative Project Delivery Methodology, which is based on industry best practices in project management generally, and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) specifically. Our comprehensive Delivery Methodology contains numerous tool-kits and frameworks to promote continuous Project Tracking and Monitoring, Quality Assurance, and Project Communication and Reporting. We have used this methodology to deliver hundreds of projects in the health and public sector. It facilitates a collaborative and high-touch working dynamic between us and our clients by meticulously tracking our progress and generating scheduled reporting with clear visuals. We have included sample graphs that may be included in status updates and touchpoints with Osler as well as a Sample Project Status Update to demonstrate what visual artifacts could be used in this project with Osler.
