Spindle Strategy Corporation (Spindle) is a privately-owned, Ontario-registered corporation. We are a  boutique strategy consulting firm with a specialization in the health sciences. Our mission is to help advance science for the public good. 

Spindle has successfully carried out multiple previous engagements that are of relevance to Osler’s request. Below we describe several previous engagements of similar scope and scale along with reference contact information. 

Generating a first-ever Strategic Plan for Research and Innovation for the Unity Health Toronto hospital network (Sept 2020-March 2021)
The proposed project team’s experience includes the crafting of a first-ever strategic plan for research and innovation for the Unity Health Toronto hospital network, one of Canada’s top 10 hospital systems encompassing St. Michael’s Hospital, St. Joseph’s Health Centre and Providence Healthcare. Spindle’s strategic planning process and product were designed to cement a distinct and recognizable niche for Unity Health Toronto’s research and innovation enterprise—one that puts the needs and desires of Toronto’s marginalized urban community at the forefront, and is firmly rooted in the institute’s principles of equitable, person-centred care. 
Our work involved the distribution of a survey to 1500 members of the Unity Health Toronto community and interviews with approximately 100 internal stakeholders and external expert opinion leaders, including community partners, leadership of other hospital systems, patient and family members, as well as Indigenous and community health clinicians. Spindle also conducted extensive quantitative research to understand and compare Unity Health’s research and innovation impact to other leading institutions globally (publications, patents, policy recommendations, investigator and trainee capacity, areas of clinical leadership), and to derive opportunities for Unity Health to make a mark on the international innovation stage. Spindle’s findings were captured in a robust diagnostic report (~50 pages), outlining the institution’s strengths, challenges and barriers, as well as key opportunities and areas of favourable positioning for value generation. Spindle then distilled an overarching value proposition and a set of strategic priorities to address the seminal issues and opportunities identified in the information gathering phase.
Working iteratively with Unity Health’s leadership team and the broader Unity Health community, through a multitude of open and invited forums, a consensus-driven strategic plan was crafted. The Strategic Plan that Spindle developed with Unity Health, clarifies Unity Health Toronto’s place in the local, regional and global health landscape, identifying four pillars of research and innovation, with an overarching focus on community health and social justice. It provides a powerful narrative and visual to describe Unity’s aspirations, a set of strategic enablers and meaningful goals, each underpinned by appropriate governance, actions and success indicators, to help advance the vision. The strategic plan has been approved by Unity Health’s Board of Directors and is now in the implementation phase.

Developing a Research and Innovation Strategic Plan for Hamilton Health Sciences (Jan 2023 - present) 
Spindle is in the midst of a 1-year strategic planning process aimed at elevating the research enterprise of Hamilton Health Sciences, a network of 11 care provider entities with five distinct research centres, focused on geriatrics, children’s health, cancer and cardiovascular disease. To deliver on this assignment, Spindle has so far completed extensive consultation with approximately 150 internal and external stakeholders. We have also gathered perspectives from approximately 200 staff and physician HHS community members through an organization-wide survey. We have carried out a comprehensive scientific review of HHS to understand the organization’s areas of strength and its competitive positioning on the global stage. In addition, we have conducted an analysis of patient volumes. quality of care performance metrics as well as a high-level scan of current and impending demographic, social, policy, economic and technological drivers in HHS’ priority clinical areas. We have consolidated insights from these various lines of investigation to delineate a number of seminal challenge/opportunity areas for HHS to address and over the course of the last 8 months have carried intensive collaborative strategy development, community building and culture change management with HHS executives, in order to articulate a sound and feasible vision, 5-year goal, strategic objectives and initiatives in response to these key imperatives. We are in the final phases of fleshing out the Strategic Plan document and in the midst of a second touch-base milestone with key stakeholders to gather additional inputs and provide an update on the strategic planning process. Upon completion of the strategic plan document (in the coming weeks), we will be supporting the HHS leadership with communications related to the launch of the strat plan and in the development of an operational and performance measurement framework. 


Spindle proposes a four-person core team consisting of Dr. Tina McDivitt Rajabian as Project Principal, Ms. Anne Hayes as Project Specialist, Mr. Mark Mairs as Project Manager, Ms. Gabrielle Mergier and Ms. Sofiya Goroshko as Project Analysts, and Ms. Kathy Jimenez as Lead, Digital and Design. For the purpose of this engagement, Spindle has struck a Strategic Advisory Group consisting of Dr. Jack Kitts, former CEO of The Ottawa Hospital and Ms. Janet Davidson, current Administrator at Nova Scotia Health Authority, former Deputy Minister of Health for Alberta and former CEO of Trillium Health Centre. The Strategic Advisory Group will liaise frequently with the core team to provide strategic insights and recommendations for the successful development of the strategic plan. Please refer to the proposal for detailed biographies of each of the proposed team members.

We will be relying on several core methodologies to complete the strategic planning engagement for Osler. These are listed below and also detailed in the proposal in the context of the the general approach and process we will be undertaking.

Review of Existing Material
As part of the information gathering phase, Spindle will complete a targeted review of existing internal material and data relating to Osler’s performance and future directions. To accelerate this process, Spindle will compile and provide a list of desired data in advance of the Kick-Off session to be reviewed and modified in collaboration with the Strategy Development Office. Information that might be desirable and relevant to the strategic planning engagement includes: strategic or priority plans, annual reports, transformation plans and business cases, historic survey data from previous community engagements, information on Osler’s population demographics and health services usage, status and burden, documents outlining relevant organizational capacities, capabilities, structures, processes, strategies, relationships, as well as performance reports related to Osler’s financial health, volumes, access, quality, safety and equity outcomes, as well as research and training capacities and results.

Stakeholder Engagement
We will aim to conduct ~60 one-on-one or small focus group interviews (primarily virtual) in Phase 1. The table in the proposal document outlines a preliminary stakeholder engagement scheme developed for project planning and scoping purposes. 
Consultations.
As part of the kick-off/ramp-up phase, we will work with the Osler Strategy Management Office to refine and enrich this list of key informants (Stakeholder Engagement Framework) so that we are engaging comprehensively and broadly, ensuring that we are including individuals and organizations who could bring seminal perspectives for shaping Osler’s future agenda. Once confirmed, Spindle will contact and schedule consultations with stakeholders. Our process for engaging with stakeholders is seamless and convenient for participants and we will conduct appropriate follow-ups and make accommodations to ensure all individuals who want to participate in the process have a chance to contribute.
Our firm has a demonstrated ability to access local and global healthcare leaders. We have a solid understanding of and hold strong relationships with key actors and opinion leaders in the academic healthcare space in Ontario, across Canada and internationally. These relationships are exponentially expanded with the participation and commitment of our strategic advisors to this engagement, who are accomplished national figures and world-renowned healthcare leaders bringing access to an expansive network of colleagues. Additionally, our proposed team leaders each bring a minimum of 15 years of experience leading and facilitating consultations and focus groups with a range of stakeholders in the healthcare sector. Our firm has led thousands of one-on-one, small group, focus group, workshop and town hall style facilitation sessions with industry executives, healthcare leaders, academics and patients and families. We feel confident in our ability to build trust and collect relevant information through our person-centred consultative process.

Virtual Facilitation Approach
Spindle has significant experience leading inclusive virtual meetings to ensure that our clients and their stakeholders can provide input through accessible, user-friendly technology. For the purposes of this engagement we intend to hold virtual one-on-one and small group consultations with key internal and external stakeholders. In these meetings, we will apply a person-centred, adaptive approach to ensure a conversational experience for the interviewees. Where appropriate (e.g. with clinicians, staff and volunteers) we intend to hold interactive workshops,  facilitated by two members of the Spindle team who will use Jamboard as a primary tool to draw out and organize different perspectives offered by the participants. We anticipate that these workshops will be most effective in brainstorming on the current state and future of Osler. We also intend to invite hospital executives and board members to engage with one or two members of our Strategic Advisory Group to learn about leading developments and best practices in areas where Osler can have a major impact. Participants will work with one or two facilitators from the Spindle Strategic Advisory Group to parse out ideas that will further inform the organization’s assessment (i.e., the challenges, operational improvement areas and innovation needs) and identify prioritized initiatives and objectives. 

Survey Design and Development 
Our internal stakeholder engagement process will include a survey to solicit input from clinicians, volunteers, hospital leaders as well as staff. The survey will be developed in collaboration with the Strategy Management Office and key members of the Executive and Board (Spindle will generate drafts and solicit input and validation from the client) and will be customized to various audience groups. The survey will be built with Spindle’s digital survey software (Typeform) and made available on our secure website. We will rely on Osler’s administrative liaison to distribute the survey link and an invitation to potential responders (invitation will be crafted by Spindle and validated by the client team). We will provide support by sending reminders and follow-ups to ensure that an appropriate response rate is reached. Our firm has extensive experience in developing, deploying and analyzing large-scale surveys to inform strategic planning for academic healthcare clients. 

Environmental Scan
Spindle is experienced in conducting complex and comprehensive environmental scans and benchmarking. Our team is highly skilled at structured purpose-driven secondary research. Aided by our digital qualitative research platform (Dovetail), we have the ability to methodically record and filter large volumes of multi-dimensional data (web content, videos, white papers, academic publications, interview transcripts etc.) and extract useful, high-value insights. As part of the work in Phase 1, we intend to conduct a web-based environmental scan to better understand the local, regional and global trends, pressures, opportunities, expectations and needs, including funding, social, economic and policy drivers that might impact the realization of Osler’s future state. Additionally, we intend to review lessons learned and strategies employed by Osler’s peers (who will be identified in collaboration with the client team based on a set of criteria). Consultations with leadership of peer organizations will complement data gleaned from the web-based environmental scan, allowing us to gain deeper insights into successes, challenges and approaches for achieving impact. 

Strategy Session
Spindle has honed a distinct strategy mapping exercise designed to help us co-create with our clients a strategy that is 1) evidence-based 2) exciting 3) tangible and 4) practical, in collaboration. Our strategy mapping session is characterized by a customized workshop experience (in-person or virtual), where participants (in this case, the Strategy Management Office and key members of the Executive and Board) will work to inform the organizations’ strategic direction through an engaging game-like process. Prior to the session, participants will work on their own time with an interactive version of the Strategy Session Primer, where they are able to view the key challenges and impact areas extracted from the stakeholder interviews and environmental scan, as well as strategic options for addressing those, and where with the aid of evaluation criteria, they will be able to select options that they deem suitable to build comprehensive and rationized strategic solutions. During the session, each participant will present their strategy “pitch” and the group then works together through a facilitated discussion to assess the strategy “pitches”, create hybrid ideas and refine the nuances of what works and what doesn't. The final outcome of the Strategy Mapping session is a validated vision, mission and values for the organization as well as a set of consensus-driven Strategic Goals. 

Project Management 
Spindle uses a robust digital project management system (Asana), to integrate and mobilize our internal team toward achieving project goals. Using the Asana software, we capture and track project activities and dependencies at various task levels and effectively manage risks around timelines and delivery. Client progress reporting is a well-established practice which starts with a kick-off/ramp up phase to refine our project plan and address the nuances and requirements of the project. In this respect, we look forward to working closely with the Osler Strategy Management Office to develop a detailed work plan for the strategic planning engagement. Weekly meetings and progress reports/updates with Osler’s client contacts will be an opportunity to provide on-going updates and to anticipate, identify, communicate and manage any emerging risks; the frequency of these meetings will be adjusted as necessary. 

Co-Creation and Communication
Spindle is committed to the iterative process of bespoke solution design; we will work continuously with the Osler client team to gain more clarity about the individualized factors that impact the success of this engagement and our recommendations, exercising utmost flexibility to accommodate shifting priorities and new opportunities for value generation. 
Our team is accustomed to working with senior decision makers in academic health science organizations through various working structures to communicate our findings in a resonant and succinct fashion, to drive consensus, co-create solutions and advance high-stakes complex initiatives. We have accounted for one formal input/feedback and presentation milestone with the Strategy Management Office and key members of the Executive and Board (the Strategy Session described above) to allow for exchange of ideas and collaborative development of the strategic plan. However, we will not hesitate to strike additional forums for discussion, progress reporting and strategy development with key stakeholders to incorporate new inputs and directions. Additionally, we recognize the critical importance of tailored communication strategies to keep constituents and stakeholders appraised of progress throughout the strategic planning engagement. We intend to develop custom presentations, briefing documents and facilitation materials to support progress reporting and continued stakeholder engagement at appropriate junctures in the strategic planning process.   

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
As a certified diverse supplier (certified member of the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council), Spindle is deeply committed to working from an anti-racist, anti-discrimination and anti-oppression framework and we foster inclusive and equitable approaches in everything that we do. We will employ a robust Equity, Diversity and Inclusion lens to all aspects of our process and also in the creation of Osler’s strategic plan. In our stakeholder engagement approach, we will anticipate and intentionally remove the many barriers that systematically exclude the voices of many non-dominant groups, for example based on professional hierarchies, stage of career and non-professional status (e.g. patients and families). Our communication materials will be written in inclusive and accessible language (including alignment with AODA standards) and, where appropriate, employ culturally-sensitive content to reach diverse stakeholders. In the context of group interviews, we will be thoughtful and intentional in making space for all to participate in generative dialogue and in lifting the voices of people with lived knowledge, experience and expertise. We will also apply an EDI lens to the formulation of strategic priorities, models and solutions for Osler. For example, in the context of governance, oversight and accountability, ensuring that diverse perspectives from within and external to Osler are justly incorporated into decision making structures and policies for any new initiatives and programs. We will also support Osler in designing processes, policies and interfaces that take an equitable and sensitive approach to service delivery, research and education. The EDI lens will also be important in organizational development and HR practices (e.g. recruiting diverse staff, nurturing diverse staff populations and monitoring their experiences) as well as in how the Osler’s performance and impacts will be determined. 
The Principal and Project Manager for this engagement are certified Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Leaders. In addition, all members of the Spindle team have received training on the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). 

Human-Centered Strategy Development
Spindle’s strategy development approach is a highly adaptable method centred around perspectives and needs. For example, Phase 1 is generally focused on listening and brainstorming with key parties around issues and questions. Phase 2 is about collaborative sense-making and coming to consensus on a high-level solution to test. Phase 3 is about testing the solution, seeking feedback and repeating steps one and two until all parties (including the Client Team) are satisfied that their needs are appropriately addressed. 

Creative Design
Spindle has nurtured strong competencies in storytelling, writing and creative design. A core differentiator of our firm is the importance we place on capturing and weaving ideas into compelling and cohesive narratives and visuals that resonate and help people to come together around a common purpose. Beyond highly designed and carefully crafted reports, we incorporate visual modelling and storytelling throughout our entire strategy design process. The Interim Report, the Strategy Session Primer, the Strategic Plan, as well as all facilitation, progress reporting and debriefing communications materials will contain accessible, visual modeling and storytelling. 

Quality Assurance
Spindle has in place rigorous quality assurance mechanisms at each stage of our strategic planning process. We work from documented standard operating procedures to carry out all project activities. During the Information Gathering Phase, we use the Calendly platform, to manage and schedule consultations and focus groups with large numbers of people in an automated and error-proof fashion. We systematically record all information in the Dovetail platform, generate weekly syntheses to capture, validate and hone key takeaways and emerging insights. In the analysis phase, we use the Dovetail platform to code all data and extract evidence-based themes in a methodical fashion. In the synthesis phase, we cross-reference insights against qualitative and quantitative evidence using Dovetail’s automated functionality. Materials are always produced by senior team members who are close to the project and have extensive writing experience. We generate documents in our collaborative Google Workspace, eliminating version control errors. All documents are polished and designed, irrespective of whether they are meant for public consumption. Prior to dissemination, documents are reviewed by our Designer, the Project Analysts, Project Manager and finally the Project Principal. 

Hand-Off and Continued Support
All data exchange for the engagement with Osler will occur via email or through a shared secured cloud drive provided by Spindle. Feedback and revisions on drafts will occur in secure Google Documents generated by Spindle and co-owned by Osler. 
Our methodology and approach for this engagement has been designed to ensure smooth transition from planning into implementation. For example, all of the deliverables for this engagement including the final Strategic Plan will be fully designed in an editable format and ownership of the documents will be 100% with Osler.

We will aim to conduct ~60 one-on-one or small focus group interviews (primarily virtual) in Phase 1. The table in the proposal  outlines a preliminary stakeholder engagement scheme developed for project planning and scoping purposes. This list includes members of the Strategy Management Office, hospital leadership (including CEO and Chief of Staff), Board members, the Medical Advisory Committee, clinicians, managerial and Director-level staff members, members from relevant committees, councils and advisory boards including Patient and Family Advisors and volunteer representatives, leadership of peer hospitals, leadership of the Centreal West Ontario Health Team, leadership of academic as well as community partners. As part of the kick-off/ramp-up phase, we will work with the Osler Strategy Management Office to refine and enrich this list of key informants (Stakeholder Engagement Framework) so that we are engaging comprehensively and broadly, ensuring that we are including individuals and organizations who could bring seminal perspectives for shaping Osler’s future agenda. Once confirmed, Spindle will contact and schedule consultations with stakeholders. Our process for engaging with stakeholders is seamless and convenient for participants and we will conduct appropriate follow-ups and make accommodations to ensure all individuals who want to participate in the process have a chance to contribute.


Comment: The communication strategy to support the engagement will include the dissemination of the core deliverables of the project, including the Interim findings Report and the Strategic Plan (and Strategic Plan Framework) to key stakeholders for review and refinement and to the broader community as deemed appropriate by the Strategy Management Office.  The Communication Strategy will also include weekly meetings and progress reports/updates with Osler’s client contacts to provide on-going updates and to anticipate, identify, communicate and manage any emerging risks; the frequency of these meetings will be adjusted as necessary.  Our team is accustomed to working with senior decision makers in academic health science organizations through various working structures to communicate our findings in a resonant and succinct fashion, to drive consensus, co-create solutions and advance high-stakes complex initiatives. As part of the communications strategy for this project, we have accounted for one formal input/feedback and presentation milestone with the Strategy Management Office and key members of the Executive and Board (the Strategy Session ) to allow for exchange of ideas and collaborative development of the strategic plan. However, we will not hesitate to strike additional forums for discussion, progress reporting and strategy development with key stakeholders to incorporate new inputs and directions. Additionally, we recognize the critical importance of tailored communication strategies to keep constituents and stakeholders appraised of progress throughout the strategic planning engagement. We intend to develop custom presentations, briefing documents and facilitation materials to support progress reporting and continued stakeholder engagement at appropriate junctures in the strategic planning process. Finally, we intend to produce a Communications Plan as an accompaniment to the Strategic Plan. This will serve as a resource for the Strategy Management Office, and it will contain the key audiences that need to be informed or mobilized vis-a-vis the strategic plan as well as key messaging, tactics and desired outcomes associated with each audience group.

In the initial  Information Gathering Phase of the project, we will create a comprehensive picture of Osler’s current state related to infrastructure and programmatic assets and offerings; culture; areas of strength and growth; historic results and challenges surrounding access, quality and safety; service area demographic breakdown; regional health status; health services usage; community and academic partnerships; strategic projects including AHSC transformation status. To achieve this, we will:
-Conduct a thorough review of existing documents (strategic plans, operational plans, master plans, annual reports, historic survey data, fundraising campaigns etc.)
-Design and deploy a survey tailored to multiple audience groups including leadership, clinicians, staff, volunteers
-Acquire and structure appropriate health system data regarding Osler's population demographics, health services usage, health status and health burden (from various public sources and as provided by Osler)
-Coalesce and conduct an integrative analysis of various data streams as part of an internally-focused organizational review, performance review and a needs assessment 
-Conduct thorough web-based, secondary research (reviewing web-based content as well as grey, white and academic literature) as part of an externally-focused environmental scan  
-Develop and refine together with the Strategy Management Office, a Consultation Plan and schedule and conduct virtual consultations and small focus groups with key internal and external stakeholders focused on identifying current state strengths and barriers as well as future state possibilities (60 sessions)
-Synthesize information and extract thematic insights from various lines of investigation into an Interim Findings Report. This report will include a Stakeholder Consultation Summary (integrated synthesis of key themes from stakeholder consultations and visioning sessions) as well as the Environmental Scan, performance review and data analysis. It will contain

In the follow-on Strategy Development Phase of the project, we will work with the Strategy Management Office to review the findings from Phase 1 and to consider the implications of this evidence for Osler’s future state, identifying specific strategic considerations and priorities to realize the future vision.  To accomplish this, we will:

-Conduct any necessary additional secondary research as well as SWOT and/or PESTLE analysis of Phase 1 data to extrapolate key strategic considerations from the themes identified in the Interim Findings Report and generate a Strategy Session Primer. This will include A summary of the findings from Phase 1 and subsequent analysis to substantiate and articulate specific strategic considerations; an evidence-based value proposition and identity; first place strategic priorities for consideration by the Strategy Management Office
-Host a strategy session with the Strategy Management Office and the client team to define the desired future state and identify key strategic considerations and priorities for realizing the future state in consideration of the findings from Phase 1, the subsequent SWOT and/or PESTLE analysis as well as the existing strategi cplan
-Develop communication materials including presentations and briefing reports to update and engage the broader stakeholder community including the board as well as executive leadership, staff and clinicians and patients and families 
-Generate a Strategic Plan Framework based on the feedback and input from the Strategy Management Office as well as the broader community. The Strategic Plan Framework will incorporate and build on the discussion with the Strategy Management Office and client team, articulating agreed upon strategic priorities as well as rationalized objectives, strategic enablers and in some cases actions to make advancements in each of the priority areas. 
-Make edits to the Framework based on feedback from the Strategy Management Office

In the final, Action Planning Phase, we will work collaboratively with the Strategy Management Office and client team through the exchange of draft documents to finalize a strategic vision and long term goal for Osler, and to coin a series of strategic priorities as well as feasible objectives and actions to advance them. We will also develop a high-level impact measurement scheme including desired outcomes and indicators of success as part of the Strategic Plan. Once the narrative is finalized, the Strategic Plan will be assembled and fully-designed into a professional Osler-branded document. 
To accomplish this, we will:
-Further synthesize and extrapolate from data gathered in Phase 1 and perspectives from the Strategy Session and follow-on engagement sessions to coin objectives and actions for each of the strategic priorities identified within the Framework
-Work iteratively with key members of the client team and Strategy Management Office through the exchange of drafts to refine and expand the Framework into a Strategic Plan and to identify key measures of success (related to outcomes and process)
-Finalize and design the Strategic Plan document
-Assist in preparing and support the delivery of a presentation of the Strategic Plan to various stakeholder groups to launch the plan
Prepare a Communications Strategy for the Strategy Management Office and client team to aid in the mobilization of various stakeholder groups towards achieving the objectives in the Strategic Plan

At the completion of this phase, we will develop a Finalized Strategic Plan (fully designed in Google Docs) and a Communications Strategy. The Strategic Plan will contain the following elements:
Foreword by the CEO and Chair of the Board 
-Strategic Considerations
-Values, Foundational Principles or Commitments
-Strategic Vision and 5-Year Goal
-Objectives 
-Strategic Enablers and Actions
-Success Road Map

The Communications Strategy will serve as a resource for the Strategy Management Office, containing the key audiences that need to be informed or mobilized vis-a-vis the strategic plan as well as key messaging, tactics and desired outcomes associated with each of the audience groups.

Spindle is well equipped to address the spectrum of potential risks that could impact the delivery of this project: 
- Lack of timely access to up-to-date population health and health services usage data at the required level of granularity to inform planning is a major risk. One of our core team members, Ms. Anne Hayes, who was previously serving as the Director of the Research Branch at the Ontario Ministry of Health is extremely well-versed in the Ontario health data landscape; she brings key connections in this space as well as a wealth of knowledge in data access pathways. Hence, we feel confident in our ability to access robust datasets for the purposes of this strategic planning engagement. 
- Given that there are multiple issues and opportunities within the healthcare sector, the vast mandate around environmental scanning raises the potential risk for information gathering to become unwieldy and lose purpose. To mitigate this risk, we will work closely with the Strategic Advisory Group to parse the landscape through their informed and highly experienced lens and ensure we remain attuned to the most pertinent developments in the topic areas of interest to Osler.   
- Spindle will generate strategic goals, objectives and initiatives that align with Osler’s current orientation, capabilities and capacities. We also intend to present future-forward and evidence-based ideas and recommendations, though we are acutely aware that they need to be feasible and aligned with Osler’s on-going strategic projects and its transformation into an academic hospital. Close communication with the Strategy Management Office as well as multiple touchpoints with the Executive and the Board, will allow us to continually fine-tune future-looking aspirations and goals to align with existing plans and emerging strategic shifts.  
- Various unanticipated external factors could result in unexpected shifts in our course of work. For example, the current healthcare workforce crisis, lack of access to primary care, ER overcrowding and COVID-related pressures may precipitate a major overhaul of health delivery models and funding schemes; Ministry of Health’s value-based model of care may create additional financial risk; flatlined budget and restraint measures will put pressure on system growth, adding risk to HR and finance planning. To mitigate these risks, we will stay alert to emerging issues, and wherever possible develop a comprehensive understanding of their potential future impacts based on best available information and expert guidance from the Strategic Advisory Group and our networks. We will then adjust and adapt our thinking, our processes and approaches in an anticipatory fashion to ensure the sustained relevance of Osler’s strategic plan into the future.


Comment: Spindle has in place an effective corporate resource management framework which helps us to ensure the proposed qualified personnel for each project are definitively available to conduct the work. For the purposes of this engagement, Spindle guarantees core specialists avaiability, with the exception of the week of Dec 25, when our offices are closed.

Comment: During the initial information gathering phase of the project, we intend to acquire and structure appropriate health system data regarding Osler's population demographics, health services usage, health status and health burden (from various public sources and as provided by Osler). We will also conduct thorough web-based, secondary research (reviewing web-based content as well as grey, white and academic literature) as part of an externally-focused environmental scan. Insights from secondary research will be complemented by perspectives we will glean from expert consultations and continued engagement with our Strategic Advisory Group. This review will be focused on Osler’s opportunities and potential barriers in aligning with the major drivers of the current academic healthcare landscape in Ontario. For example, Osler will need to remain in tune with the current post-pandemic healthcare climate and various ongoing transformations in the broader healthcare space (both regionally and globally). These include the need to cultivate workforce wellbeing as a means to maximize staff satisfaction, patient experience, quality of care and patient safety, but also to mitigate the impacts of the healthcare workforce crisis. Osler should continue to seize opportunities for driving and adopting digital healthcare solutions, including technologies to support treatment, prevention, diagnosis and palliative care in the hospital and community settings. Osler must also continue to embrace and align with emerging models of care, including integrated care (as part of the OHT restructuring), to facilitate seamless patient-centred care journeys across the system and beyond. Osler’s capabilities and capacities to deliver team-based and interprofessional education, training and care as part of its new academic mandate will also be critical drivers of its success in the coming years. As well, Osler must remain attentive to the anticipated gradual transition to value-based funding, which may involve changing models of accountability, reporting and operation to create better patient care experiences and reduce healthcare costs. When it comes to ministry support, Osler will need to continue to hone its brand and distinct value proposition as a new academic health sciences centre with community hospital roots. Finally, health equity is now explicitly articulated as part of the quintuple healthcare aims, and an area in which Osler should continue to lead, not only by bringing access to culturally responsive care for its diverse populations but also in striving to address the social determinants of health through research, knowledge translation and advocacy.


Comment: Our participation in board and executive meetings will take different forms, depending on the stage of the strategic planning process. For example, while in the information gathering phase, we will engage with Board members and the executive team through intentional visioning workshops dedicated to strategic planning. Later on, as we coalesce the Interim Findings Report, we would seek to slot a strategic planning update session into a regularly scheduled Board or Executive meeting to share a summary of our progress and findings. The Strategy Session is a collaborative sense-making exercise, which requires the participation of the Strategy Management Leadership as well as key members of the Executive and the Board. Once the Strategic Plan Framework is formulated, we would develop relevant presentations and tools to equip the strategy management leadership in providing regular updates to the Board and the Executive team. Spindle will be present as appropriate to record feedback, inputs and recommendations for the purposes of refining the Strategic Plan.

To develop a strategic plan for Osler, Spindle will employ a “What”, “So What”, “Now What” strategy development approach. This is a data-driven methodology that allows for the gradual distillation of large volumes of multi-modal information (from consultations, workshops and focus groups to survey responses, performance data, population health measures and secondary research insights) into strategic considerations and imperatives (the areas that need attention/must be addressed) and finally into specific goals and objectives. Our methodologies and platforms are perfectly suited to this evidence-driven strategy development practice, ensuring the highest degree of data and research integrity. Our stakeholder engagement approach is predicated on active listening, equitable engagement of participants and meticulous transcript-level note-taking. Aided by our digital qualitative research platform (Dovetail), we have the ability to methodically catalogue and filter large volumes of multi-dimensional data (including meeting notes, web content, videos, white papers, academic publications, interview transcripts etc.). During the information gathering phase of the project, we will systematically record all information in the Dovetail platform, and we will generate weekly syntheses to capture, validate and hone key takeaways and emerging insights as the research phase continues. In the analysis phase, we will use the Dovetail platform to code all data and extract evidence-based themes in a methodical fashion. The Interim Findings Report will be generated using key insights extracted from Dovetail through this integrative analysis. These insights will then be positioned as strategic considerations in the context of the Strategy Session Primer to inspire thinking around Osler’s future state and its key strategic priorities. These priorities are then extrapolated into objectives and actions (that are rooted in comprehensive primary and secondary research evidence).

Comment: Our team brings deep expertise in healthcare performance measurement and reporting, specifically for acute care hospitals. Ms. Janet Davidson, current Administrator of the Nova Scotia Health Authority as well as Dr. Jack Kitts, former CEO of the Ottawa Hospital bring a wealth of knowledge in this area. Furthermore, through multiple engagements with Healthcare Excellence Canada as well as CIHI, our team has developed a sound understanding of key access, quality, safety and equity measures that underpin accreditation and funding evaluations. Many of these indicators will be mapped to Osler’s strategic plan as a means to measure outcomes, allowing for the development of a renewed corporate scorecard. Other new outcome and process metrics will also be developed to measure progress in achieving the strategic plan as well as to ensure alignment between execution and strategy.

Comment: Spindle uses a robust digital project management system (Asana), to integrate and mobilize our internal team toward achieving project goals. Using the Asana software, we capture and track project activities and dependencies at various task levels and effectively manage risks around timelines and delivery. Client progress reporting is a well-established practice which starts with a kick-off/ramp up phase to refine our project plan and address the nuances and requirements of the project. In this respect, we look forward to working closely with the Osler Strategy Management Office to develop a detailed work plan for the strategic planning engagement. Weekly meetings and progress reports/updates with Osler’s client contacts will be an opportunity to provide on-going updates and to anticipate, identify, communicate and manage any emerging risks; the frequency of these meetings will be adjusted as necessary.

Please note that Spindle has nurtured strong competencies in  creative design. A core differentiator of our firm is the importance we place on capturing and weaving ideas into compelling and cohesive narratives and visuals that resonate and help people to come together around a common purpose. Beyond highly designed and carefully crafted reports, we will incorporate visual modelling and storytelling throughout the entire strategic planning process. The Interim Report, the Strategy Session Primer, the Strategic Plan, as well as all facilitation, progress reporting and debriefing communications materials will contain accessible, visual modeling and storytelling.
