Comment: Impreza Consulting is a boutique management consulting firm located in Burlington, Ontario. Impreza works on an associate partnership model; as opposed to hiring and retaining full-time resources, our firm engages subject matter experts on an as-needed basis. Sue Owen is the CEO of Impreza. Having worked in senior consulting roles for 12 years (Director of Strategy at Mount Sinai Hospital, Senior Manager, KPMG and Head of National Consulting at Philips Canada), Sue started Impreza in 2017 with a focus on Strategy, Governance and the Patient Experience. Since that time, Impreza has executed similar engagements for Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, William Osler Health System and Unity Health. Impreza’s work on personas has been profiled both Nationally (National Healthcare Leadership Conference, 2019) and Internationally (Leading Healthcare Organizations, Kuwait City, Kuwait, 2019.) Impreza’s work on designing culturally safe spaces will be profiled at the Canada West Leadership Conference in October 2023.

Comment: Sue Owen has led the development of over 40 Strategic Plans and has previous experience working at WOHS. Recent relevant experience includes: 1: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre  - development of Community Integration Strategy and Ambulatory Care Strategy 2: William Osler Health System - leading Community Engagement and Persona Development to support Clinical Services Strategy and 3: Canadian College of Health Leaders - refreshing of Corporate Strategy. All engagements utilized a multi-phased approach and leveraged stakeholder engagement, current state analysis and future state analysis to support development of recommendations and, with respect to clients #1 and #3, development of new Strategy. Impreza developed user personas for WOHS.

Comment: Impreza Consulting has put together a team of senior seasoned consultants to complete the needs of this engagement. All team members have Masters level training and all have experience in Consulting. Sue Owen and Heather Palm have led comparable Strategic Plans; both Sue and Heather worked for large consulting houses, KPMG and Deloitte, respectively. Tammie, Kathy and Maryanne are Clinicians with significant subject matter expertise in Indigenous Services, Digital Health, Health Systems and Health Education. Each of Impreza's team members brings over 25 years of experience to this engagement and each team member, in addition to consulting expertise, has held senior positions within the healthcare system


Comment: Our approach utilizes the development of a stakeholder engagement framework & map to ensure a comprehensive range of stakeholders to be engaged. Our approach includes the use of surveys, interviews, focus groups, "co-creation" Summit, development of Personas, Board and Senior Leadership Retreat, presentation(s) to key stakeholder audiences, engagement with the Strategy Management Office and weekly status reports

Comment: Our approach, in addition to using a stakeholder mapping/framework process includes a 6-phased approach. Each phase has specific activities and deliverables; these activities and deliverables have been mapped against the stakeholder framework to ensure a comprehensive, use-led process. Phases 2, 4 and 5 all involve engagement of stakeholders in accordance with the framework.

Comment: Our approch includes the hosting of weekly meetings with the Strategy Management Office and Executive Sponsor. During our first and every subsequent meeting, a communication strategy will be developed. The scope of this strategy will include communications to both internal and external stakeholders on the strategic planning process and the outcomes. The communication strategy  is intended to be a dynamic strategy, updated and recalibrated to meet the needs of this engagement

Comment: Each phase has specific activities and deliverables. In addition, we have proposed an approach that includes a Project Steering Committee, Executive Sponsor and partnership with the Strategy Management Office. Weekly meetings with the Executive Sponsor and Strategy Management Office will provide opportunities for review of interim deliverables while presentations and meetings with the Steering Committee will provide evaluation of results and offer the opportunity for all of these bodies to provide input and feedback on results. Our approach is iterative and supports ongoing feedback.

Comment: (1) Covid 19 resurgence may have an impact on a number of deliverables. Weekly meetings with Executive Sponsor/Strategy Management Office will support monitoring and adjustments as needed. While there is an opportunity to migrate to a full virtual approach, there is also a need to be cognizant of the demands that will be place on the hospital and the adjustment to the overall project approach may be warranted. (2) Delays. The project may be delayed through challenges with scheduling stakeholder events and with receiving data in a timely way. This is best mitigated through the weekly Project management meetings and making requests for data and scheduling stakeholder engagement sessions as early as possible. Weekly meetings also afford an opportunity to review the quality of data/documents and the extent to which these are 'fit for purpose' (3) Errors and stakeholder acceptance. In a project of this magnitude, it is critically important to meet early and often, ensure an iterative approach and to provide opportunities for peer review. We have proposed an approach that includes iteration and review with the Strategy Management Office, Executive Sponsor and Steering Committee. These 3 levels of review work to ensure that documents are fit for purpose, error-free and will be acceptable to other stakeholder groups such as the Board of Directors or Senior Leadership Team

Comment: Phase 1: Kick Off and Level Set. Meet with Strategy Management Office and Executive Sponsor to 'level set' on all aspects of the Project. Deliverables include agreement on documents and data to be reviewed, stakeholder engagement framework, timelines and deliverables. Timeline: Weeks 1 & 2. Phase 2: Appreciating Where We Are and Who We Serve. The focus of this Phase is threefold: i.	Appreciating Where Osler is today: Conduct a scan of the environment in which Osler is operating, including key issues and trends 
(ii).	Listening to and Learning from the People Served by Osler: Engaging in a robust stakeholder engagement process to gather feedback and insights on both Osler’s current and future states  and (iii)	Ideating on the Future: Informed by stakeholder feedback, develop recommendations for the future. The intended deliverables from this phase include:  (a)Data and document review (b) SWOT analysis (c) PESTEL analysis (d) Internal and external scan summaries, including the identification of trends and gaps (e) Jurisdictional Review of Osler peer hospitals, MOH, OH and OHT documentation highlighting trends, forecasts and future impacts (f) Identification of new and emerging opportunities (g) Assessment of the relevance and alignment of the current Strategic Plan in relation to the needs of the environment in which it is operating (h) Evaluation of Osler’s progress against its current Strategic Plan. Timelines Weeks 2-12. Phase 3 is focused on the development of 8-12 User Personas. The personas are designed to representative of the user or stakeholder 'types' and will be used to inform discussions in Phase 4. Outcomes of Phase 3 are 8-12 Personas. Timelines: Weeks  8-12. Phase 4 is focused on "Co-Creating" the Future. The focus of this Phase is engaging the broader Osler community in educational and inspirational event (“Co-Creation Summit”) designed to generate momentum and enthusiasm for the hospital’s strategy while identifying Strategic Directions and potential initiatives/opportunities. Outcomes of this Phase include (i) Engagement of the broader Osler community in the identification of Priorities and Opportunities associated with the hospital’s new Strategic Plan (ii) Leverage learnings from Phase 2 to refine Current State Assessment and identify areas of focus and opportunity to support Osler’s Future State. Timelines Weeks 12-17. Phase 5 is focused on Leverage key learnings from Phases 2 & 4 to identify Strategic Directions & Strategic Initiatives and craft the Implementation Plan. Activities in this Phase will also include defining the process to be used to confirm (re)development/refinement of Mission, Vision and Values and Promise statements if required. Outcomes from this Phase include (a) Draft Strategic Plan including Mission, Vision, Values, Strategic Directions, Strategic Initiatives and Implementation Plan. Timelines: weeks 18-20. Phase 6 is focused on the submitting the final approved Strategic Plan. The outcome is the final Strategic Plan. Timelines: Weeks 20-21.

Comment: November 3, 6, December 21 & 22, 2023

Comment: Environmental Scan complete with Gap, SWOT and PESTEL Analyses supported by: (1)Jurisdictional Review of peer Hospitals; (2) Review of Stratgegic Plans for MOH, OH, OHTs,  (3) Review of thought leadership or "white papers" on the key opportunities associated with the environment in which Osler is currently operating (4) Hosting of interviews with key system leaders/stakeholders

Comment: Consistent with those tools endorsed by the Project Management Institute, our methodology includes:
	Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities: Impreza recommends setting in place an Executive Sponsor and Steering Committee. The focus of the Executive Sponsor will be to support the day-to-day more tactical aspects of the project, and to provide preliminary review of reports and summaries. The Project Steering Committee  will be responsible for project oversight. Responsibilities will include, but not limited to reviewing and approving summary documents, reports, agendas and analyses
	Partnering with clients: In our experience, partnering with clients and including clients in work teams enables the successful achievement of results. As such, our approach includes weekly meetings with the Executive Sponsor and regular meetings with the Project Steering Committee (generally at the end of a phase or milestone completion.) It is anticipated that regular meetings with the Executive Sponsor will also include representation from the Strategy Management Office 
	Weekly reporting: Ensuring that projects are on-track requires ruthless attention to detail. Impreza will develop, on a weekly basis, project status reports and GANTT charts with milestone tracking. These reports will provide the focus for the weekly meetings with the Executive Sponsor. Meeting time with the Executive Sponsor will be used to support and provide direction on the stakeholder communication requirements associated with this engagement; and
	Quality Control: The Executive Sponsor, Board of Directors, Steering Committee, Strategy Management Office and other key Osler Stakeholders play significant roles in developing and reviewing any interim and final project deliverables.

We acknowledge that your RFP expressly states that the consultant will work in partnership with the Strategy Management Office. Our work plan reflects this effort. In addition, respectfully, we are recommending setting in place an Executive Sponsor (i.e. a single person) to serve as “point person” in the overall execution of this project. The use of an Executive Sponsor will not supplant to the partnership with the Strategy Management Office. Rather, it will ensure consistent lines of communication throughout the course of this project.

Comment: Contemporary approaches to stakeholder engagement within Strategic Planning includes a blend of in-person and virtual enagement sessions. Our stakeholder engagement framework illustrated in Phase 2 of our proposal outlines the variety of methods to be used. Through use of survey, we support the ability for stakeholders to provide asynchronous, virtual feedback. Interviews and focus groups can be hosted in virtual or in-person settings. Impreza's approach includes the development of user Personas and the hosting of a "Co-Creation" summit designed to bring together a wide variety of stakeholders in discussion designed to inspire and provide feedback on an inspired future for Osler. Our multi-phased approach includes the development of summary reports designed to characterize the learnings, feedback and outputs from each phase. Each phase has been designed to build on the other - so that feedback from Phase 2's stakeholder engagement will be used to inform discussions in Phase 4 and so on. In this way, we capture all discussions and as one Phase builds on the other, there is line of sight as to how key strategic themes have been developed

Comment: Impreza Consulting has significant and advanced experience in Executive Facilitation. In our experience, the role of the consultant during Strategic Planning process - and discussions with the Board/Executive Team/Management is that of facilitator and trusted advisor. As such, our approach includes (but is not necessarily limited to): Establishing meeting agendas in collaboration with key stakeholders, including Strategy Management Office; Starting with the End in Mind i.e. confirming the vision and desired outcomes  for the meeting; Developing an annotated agenda complete with facilitation techniques to outline the process to be used to guide discussion (this ensures that there are no surprises during meetings); identification ahead of time the potential risks or areas of contention; and development of robust summary documents.

Comment: Our multi-phased approach includes the development of summary reports designed to characterize the learnings, feedback and outputs from each phase. Each phase has been designed to build on the other - so that feedback from Phase 2's stakeholder engagement will be used to inform discussions in Phase 4 and so on. In this way, we capture all discussions and as one Phase builds on the other, there is line of sight as to how key strategic themes have been developed. Importantly, at minimum, at the end of each Phase, there is opportunity for the proposed Executive Sponsor, Strategy Management Office and proposed Steering Committee to review reports/outcomes and provide feedback/edits. This review would precede any presentation of the reports to other stakeholder audiences. As such, at each Phase there is an opportunity to review and "stress test" results to ensure alignment with leading practices and data-driven decision-making. The reports to be developed as outputs of each Phase are intentionally comprehensive, outlining processes used, documents and data sources, outcomes and recommendations

Comment: Performance monitoring is extremely critical to the implementation of Strategic Plans. As Strategic Plans are set up to include Strategic Directions, they are supported by Strategic initiatives which are also known as Objectives. Strategic Objectives reflect intended outcomes, measures (metrics) and timelines. To support implementation, this information should be presented in a tool (Logic model or balanced scorecard) that allows the organization to monitor actual results. This tool may include action steps required to implement Directions and Objectives and names of key personnel responsible for doing so. Successful implementation of the new strategy includes monitoring the planned versus actual outcomes. The organization's Board of Directors, as stewards of the organization's Mission, should have line of sight to the implementatio of the Strategic Directions though regular reporting through this tool. Strategic Planning performance indicators can employ a blend of leading and lagging indicators. Sue Owen and Impreza Consulting has experience working on Scorecards for Acute Care Centres, Academic Health Science Centres, Specialty Hospitals and Community Service Agencies

Comment: Impreza employs rigorous project management to every engagement. We develop, on a weekly basis, status reports which provide line of sight to all project activities and key dates. The status report also emphasizes activities completed, activities underway and near term activities. The report contains a risk register. On a weekly basis, this report will be shared and reviewed with the Executive Sponsor and Strategy Management Office. This allows for the project to be on-time and on-budget and to develop a plan to mitigate risks, as needed.
